# CyriacusEnglishDictionary
Author : Cyriacus Ifeanyi<br>
This an english dictionary written in Java and connected to a Mysql Database.

the current version makes use of a basic dictionary with about three column in a table called "entries"
namely: word,wordtype,definition
the dictionary has about 176023 records.

my thought for upcoming version will include more tables, fields and functionalities like {examples, synonyms ,etc..), also i will greatly enjoy your collaboration if you wish to. <br>
Thanks
